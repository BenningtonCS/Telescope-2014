newsrtsource_ver3 tar ball includes c-code for the "new" SRT
using:
       1] DAS-4020 PCI bus ADC card and in this case
you need to install the driver PCI-DAS4020-12.1.21.tgz

       2] DVB-T dongle with Rafael R820T tuner and Realtek RTL2832U
uses c code mostly from RTLSDR

       3] software FFT

       4] fast FFT for amd or intel processors

       5] FDI/USB code for AlfaRadio rot2 SPID antenna controller

The software is compiled using gcc by the bash script srtnmake
Uncomment the gcc line which matches your available hardware
Note that the libraries specified on this line need to be installed
for the compilation to complete without errors. 

This version has corrected a few problems like some overwitting of the display.
Improvements have been made in the bandpass calibration wen using the TV dongle.
The simplest version (last option in srtnmake script) which uses the TV dongle and
a software FFT is recommended. Given the narrow bandwidth of the dongle compared with
the PCI-DAS4020 the software FFT speed on most new PCs is quite satisfactory.  


Added notes:

1]  DAS-4020 PCI bus ADC card

Go through the pci-das4020-12/README file 

Then edit ADC_BUFF_PHY_SIZE accordingly in a2dc.h, to set the DMA
Buffer Size FOR EACH BOARD  and if a2dc.h is not edited

/* Note:  Edit these values for your particular system.  See README  */
#define ADC_BUFF_PHY_SIZE   0x0200000  // Physical size of the ADCs buffer
#define ADC_BUFF_PAGE_SIZE  0x0200000  /* must be a multiple of PAGE_SIZE and HALF_FIFO_SIZE and 
                                          greater than or equal to PAGE_SIZE.
                                          changed to 0x0200000 AEER
2] amd FFT

The following files library files may be required (and are included)
if the ones on the PC are not compatible:

libacml.so
libgfortran.a

3] Intel FFT

Obtain fftw from www.fftw.org download fftw-3.3.3.tar.gz
and install using float precision

4] In order to run as user 

a) FDI/USB make user member of dialout group
b) DAS-4020 copy over udev rules
c) install the udev rules file rtl-sdr.rules 
  
5] old Cassicorp antenna controller
This new release does not support the old Cassicorp antenna controller but I have included
the old code (sportold.c) which might be useful for anyone who wants to write code
for this old controller.
