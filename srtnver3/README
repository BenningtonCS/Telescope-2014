=======================================
Summary
=======================================


The Small Radio Telescope (SRT) project was started at MIT Haystack Observatory under the 
guidance of Alan Rogers. This version branched from version 3 of his SRT source, provided
on the MIT Haystack Observatory website : http://www.haystack.mit.edu/edu/undergrad/srt/

In the Version History section of the Readme, the notes for versions 1, 2, and 3 were directly
copies from the Readme file from version 1, 2, and 3 of the source, respectively. 


=======================================
Documentation
=======================================

Documentation for the build process, parts list, software installation, and hardware hints were
compiled on the GitHub wiki which this source was hosted on : https://github.com/BenningtonCS/Telescope-2014/wiki


The configuration file, srt.cat, contains keywords and values, which allow you to set parameters for 
the SRT software. A keyword usage and reference guide can be found in the srt.hlp file (which is also the
file that populates the 'Help' window in the program.)

SRTN v3		(from MIT HAYSTACK website)
=======================================

newsrtsource_ver3 tar ball includes c-code for the "new" SRT
using:
       1] DAS-4020 PCI bus ADC card and in this case
you need to install the driver PCI-DAS4020-12.1.21.tgz

       2] DVB-T dongle with Rafael R820T tuner and Realtek RTL2832U
uses c code mostly from RTLSDR

       3] software FFT

       4] fast FFT for amd or intel processors

       5] FDI/USB code for AlfaRadio rot2 SPID antenna controller

The software is compiled using gcc by the bash script srtnmake
Uncomment the gcc line which matches your available hardware
Note that the libraries specified on this line need to be installed
for the compilation to complete without errors. 

This version has corrected a few problems like some overwitting of the display.
Improvements have been made in the bandpass calibration wen using the TV dongle.
The simplest version (last option in srtnmake script) which uses the TV dongle and
a software FFT is recommended. Given the narrow bandwidth of the dongle compared with
the PCI-DAS4020 the software FFT speed on most new PCs is quite satisfactory.  


Added notes:

1]  DAS-4020 PCI bus ADC card

Go through the pci-das4020-12/README file 

Then edit ADC_BUFF_PHY_SIZE accordingly in a2dc.h, to set the DMA
Buffer Size FOR EACH BOARD  and if a2dc.h is not edited

/* Note:  Edit these values for your particular system.  See README  */
#define ADC_BUFF_PHY_SIZE   0x0200000  // Physical size of the ADCs buffer
#define ADC_BUFF_PAGE_SIZE  0x0200000  /* must be a multiple of PAGE_SIZE and HALF_FIFO_SIZE and 
                                          greater than or equal to PAGE_SIZE.
                                          changed to 0x0200000 AEER
2] amd FFT

The following files library files may be required (and are included)
if the ones on the PC are not compatible:

libacml.so
libgfortran.a

3] Intel FFT

Obtain fftw from www.fftw.org download fftw-3.3.3.tar.gz
and install using float precision

4] In order to run as user 

a) FDI/USB make user member of dialout group
b) DAS-4020 copy over udev rules
c) install the udev rules file rtl-sdr.rules 
  
5] old Cassicorp antenna controller
This new release does not support the old Cassicorp antenna controller but I have included
the old code (sportold.c) which might be useful for anyone who wants to write code
for this old controller.

SRTN v1		(from MIT HAYSTACK website)
=======================================

These are files needed to compile an executable to run the "New" SRT

see http://www.haystack.mit.edu/edu/undergrad/srt/index.html

there is a script  named srtnmake to compile:


#!/bin/bash
CFLAGS=`pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags`
LIBS=`pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --libs`
gcc -W -Wall -O3 $CFLAGS $LIBS main.c disp.c plot.c cat.c geom.c time.c outfile.c sport.c map.c cmdfl.c cal.c srthelp.c velspec.c  amdfft.c -lm  -lacml /usr/lib/libgfortran.a 
cp a.out srtn

The drivers for the ADC card  are in  PCI-DAS4020-12.1.21.tgz

This code is "preliminary" and currently only supports the old SRT controller
for antenna control.

The FFT runs on an AMD CPU and this software needs libgfortran.a and libacml.so (as there maybe problems
with the fortran library on the PC.) The fortran is only needed for AMDs cfft1d called in amdfft.c
60-mcc.rules is needed for the ADC card as well as the drivers in PCI-DAS4020-12.1.21.tgz

I hope that when and if someone decides to build the New srt receiver (which itself needs no software)
and decides to use the DAS4020-12 PCI ADC card and antenna mount controller from Alpha or rfhamdesign
I will be available to help with hardware and software issues. At present Haystack has no funds to support
further SRT development and so any assistance will have to be on a "best effort" basis.
